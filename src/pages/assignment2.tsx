          Great, now we got some typing. It's time for you to meet the team. But wait .. the team is
          hiding from you. I think there might be a small bug in{' '}
          <code>components/modules/Employees</code>. Fix it to reveal the team, and please try not
          to get scared of all those faces. ðŸ‘»
